    <h1>We want to thank everyone</h1>

    <p>who signed, gathered signatures, and otherwise helped out in our nominating petition drive.</p>

    <p>We both collected above the 100 signatures minimum needed to qualify, but enough were disqualified so that
      neither
      of us were certified as candidates.</p>

    <p>We’re going to continue to raise our issues by asking all Candidates to comment on our <a
        href="../proposals">Proposals</a>, making endorsements for the December 3rd elections.</p>

    <p>The feedback and encouragement we’ve gotten from virtually everyone who responded has been amazing! We come out
      of this effort with a great mailing list, website, and a clear understanding of what is needed to empower indie
      musicians within and through the Union.</p>

    <p> In solidarity,</p>

    <p>M Ribot and David Stern</p>

    <p>for the Indie Musicians Caucus</p>
