    <h1>We want to thank everyone</h1>

    <p>who signed, gathered signatures, and otherwise helped out in our nominating petition drive.</p>

    <p>We collected more than the 100 signature minimum needed to qualify, but enough were disqualified so that neither
      of us were certified as candidates. We got started late in this process, and were further set back by technical
      glitches and an antiquated nominating system.</p>

    <p>We’re going to continue to raise our issues by asking all Candidates to comment on our <a
        href="../proposals">Proposals</a>. We will make endorsements for the December 3rd elections based on their
      responses.</p>

    <p>The feedback and encouragement we’ve received has been overwhelming! We come out of this effort with a great
      mailing list, website, and a clear understanding of what is needed to empower indie musicians within and through
      the Union.</p>

    <p> In solidarity,</p>

    <p><span class="name">Marc Ribot</span> and <span class="name">David Stern</span></p>
